# Project Overview
**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, in this project I'll delve into Netflix data and perform some exploratory data analysis. Especifically, I'll do some research on movies released in the 1990's to better understand this awesome movie decade and dive into the entertainment industry.
